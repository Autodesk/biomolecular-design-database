## Application Stack
<br /> 
This Web Application is developed with ReactJS frontend, Node.js backend and uses PostgreSQL database.

## Usage
<br />
Quick Start

* STEP 1: Running Server Side 
-> From the console (in the project directory), do `cd ./bddbserver`. The database and Node.js application can be started using `docker-compose` 
`docker-compose up`

This will start the Node.js application on port 8000 on the docker machine. 

* STEP 2: Running Client Side
-> From the console (in the project directory), do `cd ./bddbclient`. The reactJS frontend can be started using `docker-compose` 
`docker-compose up`

This will start the client side application on port 3000 on the docker machine.
